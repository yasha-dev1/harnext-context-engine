"""The harness abstraction.

A Harness runs a coding agent over a working directory (the mounted org context
FS) to incorporate events, and returns a uniform ``ConversationTranscript``.
Both Claude Code (Claude Agent SDK, in-process) and Codex (``codex exec``) can
implement it. The harness only touches files under ``working_dir`` — it knows
nothing about Kafka, the org DB, or snapshots — which is what keeps builder
agents stateless. ``files_changed`` is recomputed from the FS by the runner, not
trusted from the model, so persistence is decoupled from which agent ran.
